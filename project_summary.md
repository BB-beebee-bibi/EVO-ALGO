# Trisolaris Evolution Framework & Progremon System

## Project Overview

The Trisolaris Evolution Framework is a system for evolving code solutions using genetic algorithms with a particular focus on ethical considerations. The framework includes:

- **Core Evolution Engine**: Manages population, mutation, crossover, and selection
- **CodeGenome**: Represents code as AST structures that can be mutated and crossed over
- **FitnessEvaluator**: Evaluates code based on functionality, efficiency, and ethical alignment
- **EthicalBoundaryEnforcer**: Prevents harmful or unethical code patterns

The "Progremon" system wraps Trisolaris with a user-friendly CLI that uses natural language input to configure and run evolutionary processes.

## Recent Improvements

1. **Enhanced Task Selection**:
   - Explicit task selection step in Progremon CLI
   - Better UI for displaying and selecting tasks
   - Clear visual highlighting of task parameter

2. **USB Scanner Template**:
   - Implemented a complete starter template with working USB scanning functionality
   - Simplified implementations with helpful comments
   - Structure follows the three key functions: find_usb_drives, get_drive_info, scan_directory

3. **Custom Validation**:
   - Added support for custom validators in FitnessEvaluator
   - Validators made more robust to handle simple and complex return values
   - Each test case custom-tailored to the USB scanning functions

4. **Ethical Boundary Customization**:
   - Created USB-specific ethical boundary settings
   - Relaxed file operation restrictions for USB drives
   - Added necessary imports for USB operations

## Observed Issues

1. **Validator Warnings**: Many "Custom validator failed: 'int' object is not iterable" warnings indicate the code is producing integers instead of the expected data structures

2. **Simple Solutions**: Evolution tends to favor ultra-simple solutions (e.g., `def vvqym(): return 0`) that don't satisfy the task requirements

3. **Template Usage**: Template files may not be properly used as starting points in some cases

## Recommendations for Next Steps

1. **Fitness Function Improvements**:
   - Add more granular fitness scoring for partial solutions
   - Implement "stepping stone" fitness cases that build complexity gradually
   - Increase the weight of functionality over other metrics for task-specific evolution

2. **Template Enforcement**:
   - Ensure template structure is maintained through evolution
   - Consider "protected" sections that don't get mutated but guide implementation
   - Add function signatures as fixed constraints

3. **Evolution Parameter Tuning**:
   - Experiment with higher mutation rates (0.2-0.3)
   - Increase population size (50-100)
   - Run for more generations (50+)
   - Add diversity maintenance mechanisms

4. **Environment Configuration**:
   - Create controlled test environments for USB scanning
   - Build a suite of simulated USB drive structures
   - Add time-out mechanisms for potentially slow operations

5. **Integration Testing**:
   - Create automated test suite for core components
   - Add regression tests for specific tasks like USB scanning
   - Implement continuous evolution runs with result tracking

## Future Feature Ideas

1. **Natural Language Processing**:
   - Integrate LLM APIs to translate natural language requests into task configurations
   - Use LLMs to generate fitness test cases from descriptions
   - Enhance template generation from descriptions

2. **Evolution Visualization**:
   - Real-time fitness and diversity graphs
   - Animated genealogy of solutions
   - Interactive "breeding" of promising solutions

3. **Multi-Task Evolution**:
   - Evolve multiple functions simultaneously
   - Build systems of cooperating components
   - Transfer learning between related tasks
