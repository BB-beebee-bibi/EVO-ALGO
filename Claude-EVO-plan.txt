Enhanced Fitness Evaluation
Based on feedback, the fitness evaluation is restructured to properly handle ethical boundaries:

Ethical Boundary Layer (Hard Filter)

Acts as a pre-filter before fitness calculation
Immediately rejects solutions that violate core principles
Examples: unauthorized system calls, privacy violations, unbounded resource usage


Three-Tier Fitness Function (For solutions passing the boundary layer)

Alignment Score (highest weight, 50%):

Resource efficiency metrics
Potential impact assessment
Privacy and security measures


Functionality Score (middle weight, 30%):

Test case pass rate
Edge case handling
Correctness verification


Efficiency Score (lowest weight, 20%):

Execution time
Memory usage
Code complexity metrics





Evolutionary Operators Enhancements
Mutation Operators:

Syntax-Aware Mutations: Leveraging ASTs to ensure valid code
Semantic-Preserving Mutations: Refactoring that maintains behavior
Self-Adaptive Mutation Rates: Step sizes that evolve with the population
Targeted Mutations: Guided by static analysis to focus on problem areas

Crossover Mechanisms:

Module-Level Recombination: Swapping logical components between solutions
Homologous Crossover: Matching similar code structures for recombination
Multi-point Crossover: Combining multiple elements from successful parents
Function Signature Preservation: Maintaining interfaces during recombination

Selection Strategies:

Modified Tournament Selection: With diversity bonuses
Non-Dominated Sorting: For multi-objective selection
Elitism with Diversity Preservation: Keeping best solutions while maintaining variety
Adaptive Selection Pressure: Based on population convergence metrics

Island Model Implementation
The system will maintain multiple subpopulations with different characteristics:

Explorer Islands: Higher mutation rates, focus on novel solutions
Optimizer Islands: Lower mutation rates, focus on refining existing solutions
Specialist Islands: Targeted to specific aspects of the problem
LLM-Guided Islands: Each potentially linked to a different AI model
Migration Protocol: Periodic exchange of successful individuals between islands

Thoughtful Pauses and Reflection
Following the recommendation from the Gemini feedback, the system will implement:

Generational Reflection Points: Periodic analysis of population trends
Novelty Detection: Pausing for deeper evaluation when unexpected solutions emerge
Human-in-the-Loop Options: Critical decision points where human guidance can be requested
Ethical Impact Analysis: Deeper evaluation of high-fitness solutions before adoption

Resource Management Integration
To maintain the ≥25% resource availability mandate:

Dynamic Throttling: Adjust population size and evaluation frequency based on system load
Surrogate Fitness Models: ML models to approximate expensive evaluations
Batch Processing: Group similar evaluations for efficient execution
Hybernation/Resume: Ability to pause evolution and persist state when resources are needed elsewhere
Resource Footprint Tracking: Monitor and log resource usage over time

Integration with Development Workflow
For New Projects:

Create a project with TRISOLARIS integration built-in from the start
Define initial fitness criteria based on project goals
Set up test cases and boundary conditions
Initialize with seed solutions if available

For Existing Projects:

Add TRISOLARIS as a module to the project

**T**horoughly **R**ecursive **I**terative **S**ystem for **O**rganic **L**earning and **A**daptive **R**esource-**I**ntelligent **S**olutions

## Overview

TRISOLARIS is an evolutionary computation framework that applies natural selection principles to iteratively improve code, configurations, and designs. The system generates random "mutations" of code, evaluates them against fitness criteria, selects the most successful variants, and recombines them to create increasingly effective solutions.

## Core Principles

TRISOLARIS operates on three fundamental priorities:

1. **Alignment**: Solutions must adhere to core principles including resource efficiency, privacy preservation, and potential impact minimization.

2. **Functionality**: Code must work correctly, satisfying all requirements and test cases.

3. **Efficiency**: Solutions should minimize resource usage, execution time, and complexity.

## Key Features

- **Adaptive Landscape Navigation**: Mathematical models for efficiently exploring the solution space
- **Ethical Boundary Enforcement**: Hard constraints on solution behavior to ensure alignment
- **Island Ecosystem Model**: Multiple subpopulations evolving with different selection pressures
- **Resource-Aware Processing**: Dynamic throttling to maintain system responsiveness
- **Diversity Preservation**: Techniques to prevent premature convergence
- **Visualization Tools**: Interactive monitoring of evolution progress
- **Git-Based Lineage Tracking**: Complete history of solution development

## Quick Start

```python
from trisolaris import EvolutionEngine
from trisolaris.evaluation import FitnessEvaluator

# Define fitness criteria
evaluator = FitnessEvaluator()
evaluator.add_test_case(input_data, expected_output)
evaluator.add_ethical_boundary("no_system_calls")
evaluator.add_resource_constraint(max_memory_mb=100)

# Create evolution engine
engine = EvolutionEngine(population_size=100, evaluator=evaluator)

# Run evolution
engine.evolve(generations=50)

# Get best solution
best_solution = engine.get_best_solution()
print(best_solution.source_code)

Ethical Boundaries: Carefully define hard constraints to ensure evolved code aligns with principles
Resource Awareness: Configure resource limits to prevent evolution from impacting other processes
Review Evolved Code: Always review solutions before incorporation into production
Maintain Diversity: Periodically inject fresh ideas into the evolution process


### 5. Core Component READMEs

**trisolaris/core/README.md**:
```markdown
# TRISOLARIS Core Components

The core module contains the fundamental components of the TRISOLARIS framework:

## Engine (engine.py)

The `EvolutionEngine` class implements the main evolutionary loop. Key features:

- Population initialization
- Generational progression
- Integration with fitness evaluation
- Termination criteria handling

```python
from trisolaris.core import EvolutionEngine

# Create engine with default parameters
engine = EvolutionEngine(population_size=100)

# Configure custom parameters
engine.set_selection_pressure(0.8)
engine.set_mutation_rate(0.1)
engine.set_crossover_rate(0.7)

# Run evolution
best_solution = engine.evolve(generations=50)
Landscape (landscape.py)
The AdaptiveLandscape class implements the mathematical foundation of the evolution process:

Models the fitness landscape for navigating solution space
Calculates selection gradients to guide evolution
Provides visualization capabilities

pythonfrom trisolaris.core import AdaptiveLandscape

# Create landscape based on fitness function
landscape = AdaptiveLandscape(fitness_function=my_fitness_function)

# Calculate gradient at a point
gradient = landscape.get_gradient(solution)

# Visualize landscape
landscape.visualize(population=my_population)
Genome (genome.py)
The CodeGenome class represents a single solution in the population:

Encodes code as manipulable data structure (AST or graph)
Implements variation operators (mutation, crossover)
Provides conversion to/from source code

pythonfrom trisolaris.core import CodeGenome

# Create genome from source code
genome = CodeGenome.from_source("def factorial(n):\n    return 1 if n <= 1 else n * factorial(n-1)")

# Apply mutation
genome.mutate(rate=0.1)

# Apply crossover with another genome
child = genome.crossover(other_genome)

# Convert to source code
source = genome.to_source()
Extension Points
The core components are designed to be extended for specific use cases:

Subclass CodeGenome to implement domain-specific representations
Subclass AdaptiveLandscape to implement specialized landscape models
Extend EvolutionEngine to customize the evolutionary process


**trisolaris/evaluation/README.md**:
```markdown
# TRISOLARIS Evaluation Components

The evaluation module contains components for assessing solution fitness:

## Fitness Evaluator (fitness.py)

The `FitnessEvaluator` class evaluates solutions based on multiple objectives:

- Alignment with principles
- Functional correctness
- Resource efficiency

```python
from trisolaris.evaluation import FitnessEvaluator

# Create evaluator with default weights
evaluator = FitnessEvaluator()

# Configure custom weights
evaluator.set_weights(alignment=0.5, functionality=0.3, efficiency=0.2)

# Add test cases
evaluator.add_test_case(input_data=5, expected_output=120)
evaluator.add_test_case(input_data=0, expected_output=1)

# Evaluate a solution
fitness = evaluator.evaluate(genome)
Ethical Filter (ethical_filter.py)
The EthicalBoundaryEnforcer class implements hard constraints for solutions:

Static analysis for unsafe operations
Resource usage limits
Privacy and security checks

pythonfrom trisolaris.evaluation import EthicalBoundaryEnforcer

# Create enforcer with default boundaries
enforcer = EthicalBoundaryEnforcer()

# Add specific boundaries
enforcer.add_boundary("no_system_calls")
enforcer.add_boundary("max_execution_time", timeout_seconds=5)
enforcer.add_boundary("no_network_access")

# Check if solution passes boundaries
if enforcer.check(genome):
    # Solution is acceptable
    fitness = evaluator.evaluate(genome)
else:
    # Solution violates boundaries
    fitness = 0
Surrogate Models (surrogate.py)
The SurrogateModel class provides efficient approximations for expensive evaluations:

Machine learning models trained on previous evaluations
Prediction of fitness without full evaluation
Confidence estimation for predictions

pythonfrom trisolaris.evaluation import SurrogateModel

# Create and train surrogate model
surrogate = SurrogateModel()
surrogate.train(previous_genomes, previous_fitness_scores)

# Predict fitness for new solution
predicted_fitness, confidence = surrogate.predict(genome)

# Use prediction if confidence is high enough
if confidence > 0.8:
    fitness = predicted_fitness
else:
    fitness = evaluator.evaluate(genome)  # Full evaluation
Extension Points
The evaluation components are designed to be extended:

Subclass FitnessEvaluator for domain-specific evaluation
Add custom boundaries to EthicalBoundaryEnforcer
Implement specialized surrogate models
