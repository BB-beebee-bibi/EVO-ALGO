 ini# TRISOLARIS Framework Improvements

This document details the improvements made to the TRISOLARIS evolutionary algorithm framework according to the priority areas specified in the project requirements.

## 1. Directory Structure Reorganization

✅ **Completed**

- Confirmed `minja_usb_scan.py` is properly located in the `minja/` directory
- Removed the duplicate file from the root directory
- Created the `outputs/` directory for timestamped evolution runs
- Implemented the path utilities in `trisolaris/utils/paths.py` to handle:
  - Timestamped output directories: `outputs/run_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS/`
  - Generation-specific directories: `outputs/run_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS/generation_N/`
  - Functions to retrieve latest runs and best solutions

## 2. Resource Management

✅ **Completed**

- Verified and enhanced the `ResourceSteward` implementation in `trisolaris/managers/resource.py`
- Added features to:
  - Monitor CPU/memory usage during evolution runs
  - Dynamically adjust population size and other parameters based on available resources
  - Ensure 25% of system resources remain available at all times
  - Apply throttling when resources are constrained
  - Generate resource usage reports

## 3. Ethical Boundaries

✅ **Completed**

- Verified the comprehensive implementation of `EthicalBoundaryEnforcer` in `trisolaris/evaluation/ethical_filter.py`
- Added robust safety checks including:
  - Restrictions on system calls, eval/exec, file operations, and network access
  - Memory and execution time limits
  - Import restrictions to prevent malicious code
  - Gurbani-inspired ethical principles (universal equity, truthful communication, etc.)

## 4. Performance Optimization

✅ **Completed**

- Implemented the `IslandEcosystemManager` in `trisolaris/managers/island.py` for running multiple subpopulations with:
  - Different selection pressures
  - Different mutation rates across islands
  - Periodic migration of individuals between islands
  - Performance metrics and reporting

- Added `DiversityGuardian` in `trisolaris/managers/diversity.py` with:
  - Genotypic and phenotypic diversity tracking
  - Multiple diversity injection strategies (mutation, immigration, restart)
  - Novelty search capabilities
  - Protection against premature convergence

## 5. Integration

✅ **Completed**

- Updated `run.py` to integrate all new components:
  - Added command-line options for all new features
  - Implemented timestamped output directories
  - Added resource monitoring capabilities
  - Enhanced ethical filtering options
  - Built in version control with Git

- Created proper Python package structure:
  - Added/updated `__init__.py` files for proper imports
  - Ensured consistent interface between components
  - Maintained modularity for extensibility

## 6. Documentation

✅ **Completed**

- Created detailed `README.md` explaining:
  - Core architecture and components
  - Project structure
  - Recent improvements
  - Usage instructions and command-line options
  - Requirements
  - Design principles

- Added comprehensive docstrings and comments throughout the codebase

## Alignment with Design Principles

All improvements align with the Gurbani-inspired design principles specified in the project guidelines:

1. **Unity in Design**: Modular architecture with clear interfaces
2. **Natural Flow**: Resource-aware design that adapts to available capacity
3. **Truth and Transparency**: Clear logging and reporting mechanisms
4. **Service-Oriented Architecture**: Components designed to serve user needs
5. **Balance and Harmony**: Balanced approach to automation and human oversight
6. **Ego-Free Development**: Focus on functionality over complexity
7. **Universal Design**: Accessible and configurable framework
8. **Mindful Resource Usage**: Efficient resource management and monitoring

## Future Work

While all priority improvements have been completed, future enhancements could include:

1. Enhanced visualization of the evolutionary process
2. Web-based monitoring interface for long-running evolutions
3. Multi-objective optimization capabilities
4. Addition of more mutation and crossover operators
5. Integration with external testing frameworks for fitness evaluation
