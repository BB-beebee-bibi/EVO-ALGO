# PROGREMON Project Progress Summary

## Project Evolution

The PROGREMON project (previously known as EVO-ALGO) has undergone significant transformation from its initial concept to its current implementation. The project now features a modular, task-based architecture built around the TRISOLARIS framework, which serves as the evolutionary engine for generating specialized programs (PROGREMONs).

## Core Architecture

### TRISOLARIS Framework
The TRISOLARIS framework is now a fully modular, task-agnostic evolutionary engine that:
1. Implements a sophisticated genetic algorithm for code evolution
2. Provides resource monitoring and management capabilities
3. Ensures ethical boundaries through configurable filters
4. Includes advanced features like island-based evolution and diversity preservation
5. Maintains comprehensive tracking and logging of the evolutionary process

### Task-Based Design
We've implemented a clean separation between:
- **Core Evolution Engine**: The mathematics and algorithms of evolution
- **Task Definitions**: What the evolved code should accomplish
- **Execution Environment**: Where and how the code runs

This separation allows TRISOLARIS to evolve code for any task by simply defining a new TaskInterface implementation.

## Implemented Tasks

### Drive Scanner
- Scans connected storage devices
- Creates detailed snapshots of drive contents
- Identifies file types and organizes information
- Successfully evolved with optimizations beyond the template implementation

### Network Scanner
- Scans local networks for connected devices
- Identifies device types including IoT devices
- Reports detailed information about discovered devices
- Focuses on finding specific devices like Nest thermostats

## Technical Improvements

### Resource Management
- Dynamic throttling based on available system resources
- Memory and CPU usage monitoring
- Efficient resource allocation during evolution

### Ethical Boundaries
- Comprehensive safety checks on evolved code
- Prevention of potentially harmful operations
- Gurbani-inspired ethical principles integration

### Performance Optimization
- Island-based evolution for parallel exploration of solution space
- Diversity preservation mechanisms
- Efficient fitness evaluation strategies

## Future Directions

### Immediate Focus
- Bluetooth IoT device scanner with security vulnerability detection
- More sophisticated fitness evaluation for security applications
- Enhanced user interfaces for PROGREMON outputs

### Long-term Vision
- Self-evolving PROGREMONs that can modify themselves based on changing environments
- More sophisticated multi-objective optimization
- Expanded library of task templates and evolution strategies

## Project Philosophy

The PROGREMON project embraces the following principles:
1. **Evolution over Design**: Let mathematics guide the development of solutions
2. **Task Independence**: Clear separation between what to do and how to do it
3. **Ethical Guidelines**: Ensure evolved solutions operate within safe boundaries
4. **Resource Awareness**: Adapt to available computational resources
5. **Knowledge Preservation**: Maintain and build upon successful evolutionary paths

This project represents a significant step toward autonomous program evolution guided by clearly defined constraints and objectives.
