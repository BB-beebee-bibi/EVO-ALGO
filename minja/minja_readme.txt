# Minja: Minimalist Reconnaissance Agent

## Vision
Minja is designed as a lightweight, boundary-respecting reconnaissance and system analysis tool. It aims to gather structural information about systems or environments with minimal intrusion and impact, prioritizing stealth and leaving no trace while providing valuable insights. Its operation is guided by principles of precision and respect for system integrity.

## Project History & Evolution
- **Initial Idea:** Develop a tool for system discovery and analysis that operates with extreme subtlety and minimal footprint.
- **Core Design:** Focused on techniques that gather metadata and structural information rather than deep content inspection.
- **Key Features:** Likely included capabilities for network mapping, service identification, configuration analysis, and potentially lightweight vulnerability assessment, all designed with minimal interaction.
- **Self-Sufficiency:** Emphasis on self-contained operation and self-cleaning capabilities to ensure no residual impact.
- **Principle Integration:** Aligned with foundational principles (derived from Gurbani/Concord) emphasizing respect for boundaries, causing no disruption (non-harm), acting truthfully (accurate reporting), and operating with balance (minimal necessary action).

## Foundational Inspirations (Internal)
Derived principles guiding the tool's design and operation:
-   **Respect for Boundaries:** Operating strictly within defined or inferred limits.
-   **Minimal Impact/Non-Harm:** Gathering information without causing disruption or degradation.
-   **Truthful Representation:** Accurately reporting findings without distortion.
-   **Precision & Necessity:** Performing only the actions required for the reconnaissance goal.

## Core Principles (Operationalized)
1.  **Minimal Footprint:** Utilize techniques that generate minimal network traffic and system load.
2.  **Boundary Adherence:** Strictly respect defined access controls and avoid unauthorized exploration.
3.  **Metadata Focus:** Prioritize gathering structural information (e.g., service versions, configurations, network topology) over accessing content.
4.  **Leave No Trace:** Ensure operations are non-persistent and self-cleaning where possible.
5.  **Accurate Reporting:** Present gathered information factually without speculation.
6.  **Targeted Action:** Execute reconnaissance steps specifically relevant to the defined objective.

## Core Objectives
1.  **Subtle Reconnaissance:** Gather system/network information without triggering alarms or causing noticeable impact.
2.  **Structural Analysis:** Map system architectures, identify running services, and analyze configurations.
3.  **Boundary Respect:** Operate ethically by default, respecting access limitations and privacy.
4.  **Minimalism:** Achieve reconnaissance goals with the least necessary interaction and resource usage.
5.  **Self-Sufficiency:** Operate as a self-contained tool with minimal external dependencies during operation.

## Technical Components (Conceptual)
-   **Discovery Module:** Network scanning, service identification (e.g., port scanning, banner grabbing - designed for low impact).
-   **Analysis Engine:** Configuration parsing, dependency mapping, structural analysis.
-   **Stealth Mechanisms:** Techniques to minimize operational signature (e.g., traffic shaping, timing adjustments).
-   **Reporting Unit:** Generates factual summaries of findings.
-   **Self-Cleaning Routine:** Removes temporary files or state changes upon completion (where applicable).
-   **Boundary Governor:** Internal checks to prevent exceeding defined operational scopes.

## Implementation Phases
### Phase 1: Core Discovery
-   Implement basic network scanning and service identification.
-   Develop initial reporting functionality.
-   Focus on minimal footprint techniques.

### Phase 2: Structural Analysis
-   Add configuration analysis capabilities.
-   Develop dependency mapping features.
-   Refine reporting for clarity.

### Phase 3: Enhanced Subtlety
-   Implement advanced stealth mechanisms.
-   Develop self-cleaning capabilities.
-   Integrate boundary governance checks.

### Phase 4: Targeted Modules
-   Create specialized modules for specific environments or technologies.
-   Develop options for focused, objective-driven reconnaissance.
-   Optimize for low-resource environments.

## Design Philosophy (Implicit Guidance)
-   **Respect:** Operate with deference to system boundaries and integrity.
-   **Precision:** Act with focus and minimal necessary force.
-   **Subtlety:** Prioritize unobtrusive methods.
-   **Objectivity:** Report findings factually.
-   **Cleanliness:** Leave no trace of operation.

## Success Criteria
-   Successfully gathers target information with minimal detectability.
-   Adheres strictly to defined operational boundaries.
-   Generates accurate, factual reports.
-   Demonstrates minimal resource consumption and system impact.
-   Leaves no persistent artifacts after operation.

## Connection to Other Projects
-   **Citadel:** Minja could be used to assess the structural integrity or potential vulnerabilities of systems protected by Citadel, operating within its principles.
-   **Mool/Trisolaris:** Could potentially provide environmental context to cooperative agents, operating respectfully.
-   **Gurbani Project:** Provides foundational principles guiding Minja's design (respect for boundaries, minimal action).

## Next Steps
1.  Define core reconnaissance techniques aligned with minimal impact.
2.  Implement basic Discovery and Reporting modules.
3.  Develop initial Boundary Governor logic.
4.  Test against controlled environments.
