# TRISOLARIS Framework AST Module Updates

## Overview

This document outlines the updates made to the TRISOLARIS evolutionary framework's AST handling to ensure compatibility with future Python versions (3.14+) where deprecated AST nodes will be removed.

## Key Updates

### 1. Modern AST Utilities

Created a new module `trisolaris/core/ast_utils.py` that provides modern, future-proof implementations of:
- `ModernMutationTransformer`: Uses `ast.Constant` instead of deprecated node types
- `ModernAstCrossover`: Compatible with Python 3.8+ AST nodes
- `ModernSubtreeCollector`: Properly handles modern AST structure

### 2. Modern AST Node Types Only

Removed all deprecated AST node types and exclusively use modern equivalents:
- `ast.Constant` only for all literal values (replaces ast.Num, ast.Str, and ast.NameConstant)
- No backward compatibility code for older Python versions
- **Minimum Python version requirement: 3.8+**

### 3. Value Access Changes

- Updated value access patterns: 
  - Consistently use `node.value` for accessing literal values
  - Proper type checking with `isinstance(node.value, (int, float, str, bool))`

### 4. Integration with Main Framework

Modified `trisolaris/core/genome.py` to:
- Import the new modern AST utilities module
- Use `ModernMutationTransformer` instead of the old `MutationTransformer`
- Clean up redundant and duplicated code

### 5. Additional Module Updates

Updated other framework modules to use modern AST handling:

#### Ethical Filter Module
Modified `trisolaris/evaluation/ethical_filter.py` to:
- Update docstring detection to use `ast.Constant` in the `_check_service_oriented` method
- Remove all legacy node type detection

#### Fitness Evaluation Module
Modified `trisolaris/evaluation/fitness.py` to:
- Update error message detection to use `ast.Constant` in the `_measure_service_orientation` method
- Remove all legacy node type detection

## Benefits

1. **Future-proofing**: Code will continue to work in Python 3.14+ when deprecated AST nodes are removed
2. **Cleaner code**: Using the unified `ast.Constant` approach results in more consistent and maintainable code
3. **Improved security**: Modern Python versions have better security features and fewer vulnerabilities
4. **Improved maintainability**: Cleaner codebase without backward compatibility checks
5. **Better performance**: Modern AST handling is more efficient

## Security Benefits

By requiring Python 3.8+, we gain several security benefits:
1. More recent security patches and bug fixes
2. Better support for modern cryptographic algorithms
3. Reduced attack surface compared to older Python versions
4. Standardized approaches to security-critical code

## Requirements

- **Python 3.8 or newer is required**
- All dependencies should be compatible with Python 3.8+
- Code will not work with Python 3.7 or older

## Testing

The updates have been tested with the test suite to ensure:
- Compatibility with current Python versions
- No regressions in mutation and crossover functionality
- Proper handling of all AST node types 
- CodeGenome tests pass successfully with the updated AST handling
