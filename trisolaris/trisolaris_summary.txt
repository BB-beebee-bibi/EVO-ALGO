# Trisolaris Project Summary

## Purpose & Vision
Trisolaris is a framework designed to facilitate cooperative work among multiple AI agents (like mool instances) as peers. It promotes decentralized problem-solving, aiming for emergent solutions through balanced, dynamic interactions and shared responsibility, moving beyond traditional hierarchical control.

## Project History & Evolution
- **Inception:** Inspired by principles of equality and collective action, aiming to create a non-hierarchical AI cooperation protocol.
- **Design:** Focused on core mechanisms like dynamic role rotation (Leader, Worker, Observer) and shared context management.
- **Mool Synergy:** Envisioned as a cooperation layer for the mool micro-system, enabling its collaborative potential.
- **Refinement:** Ongoing focus on operationalizing principles like equality, shared understanding, and emergent solutions within the framework's protocols.

## Core Principles (Operationalized)
-   **Dynamic Roles:** Fluid assignment of roles prevents fixed hierarchies.
-   **Shared Context:** Mechanisms ensure agents have synchronized environmental/task understanding.
-   **Peer Communication:** Direct agent-to-agent interaction for coordination.
-   **Emergent Resolution:** Solutions arise from agent interactions, not top-down commands.
-   **Adaptive Balancing:** Dynamic task distribution based on capacity/role.
-   **Principle Alignment:** Designed to work with agents operating under compatible core principles (e.g., mool).

## Key Objectives
-   Enable decentralized AI cooperation without a central controller.
-   Facilitate emergent solutions from simpler agent interactions.
-   Build resilience through distributed responsibility.
-   Ensure balanced participation via role rotation.
-   Design for scalability with varying numbers of agents.

## Technical Architecture
-   **Framework Components:** Role Manager, Context Synchronizer, Task Distributor, Communication Bus, Consensus Module, Agent Interface.
-   **Agent Roles:** Leader (temporary coordinator), Worker (task executor), Observer (monitor/verifier) - roles rotate.
-   **Features:** Dynamic role rotation, shared state protocols, consensus mechanisms, integration points for principle-driven agents.

## Design Philosophy (Implicit Guidance)
-   **Decentralization:** Avoid single points of control/failure.
-   **Equality:** Promote fairness through dynamic roles.
-   **Emergence:** Value solutions arising from interaction.
-   **Cooperation:** Design for mutual support.
-   **Adaptability:** Enable fluid response to changing conditions.

## Implicit Guidance Goal
The framework itself, through its structure (role rotation, peer communication, consensus), is intended to embody and promote cooperation, balance, and shared responsibility. Systems built using Trisolaris should inherently exhibit these characteristics.

## Connection to Other Projects
-   **Mool:** The intended primary agent type for Trisolaris, providing the individual principle engines.
-   **Gurbani Project:** Source of foundational principles influencing the framework's design philosophy.

## Success Metrics
-   Effective decentralized task completion.
-   Resilience to agent failure.
-   Balanced agent participation.
-   Emergence of non-explicitly programmed solutions.
-   Smooth integration with mool or similar agents.

## Path of Development
1. **Initial Concept**:
   - Created as a collaborative workflow framework
   - Originated from the idea that different AI systems have complementary strengths
   - Developed with built-in role rotation to ensure diverse perspectives

2. **Design Evolution**:
   - Initially, three separate drafts were created by Claude, ChatGPT, and Gemini
   - Each AI contributed unique elements to the protocol design
   - Human feedback integrated the best elements of each draft
   - Resulted in a comprehensive collaborative framework

3. **Implementation Progress**:
   - Created directory structure definition
   - Developed protocol documentation
   - Planned functionality for the `trisolaris.py` script
   - Designed template formats for different roles

## Current State
- **Documentation Complete**: Protocol fully documented in `TRISOLARIS_FINAL.txt`
- **Framework Defined**: Clear structure for multi-AI collaboration established
- **Implementation Planned**: CLI tool design in progress
- **Directory Structure Created**: Basic structure for project organization
- **Integration with Mool**: Connection to the Mool project established

## Key Components
1. **Core Protocol**:
   - Role-based collaboration system
   - Iterative development cycle
   - Document templates for consistency
   - Role rotation mechanism

2. **Defined Roles**:
   - **Architect**: Designs solution and creates architecture documents
   - **Developer**: Implements working code based on architecture plans
   - **Reviewer**: Analyzes both architecture and implementation
   - **Integrator**: Synthesizes feedback and creates unified solutions

3. **Technical Framework**:
   - Defined directory structure
   - Command-line interface (planned)
   - Document templates
   - Version tracking system

## Challenges and Limitations
- Implementation of the CLI tool remains incomplete
- Integration with various AI systems requires standardization
- Needs testing in real-world collaborative projects
- Potential for conflicting approaches between AI systems

## Trajectory Forward
1. **Immediate Next Steps**:
   - Implement the `trisolaris.py` script
   - Create first test project using the protocol
   - Deploy on the new Linux SSD environment
   - Establish initial AI team workflows

2. **Medium-term Goals**:
   - Test and refine the protocol through real projects
   - Add consensus engine for automatic synthesis
   - Develop evaluation metrics for contributions
   - Create visualization tools for project progress

3. **Long-term Vision**:
   - Build comprehensive multi-AI collaboration platform
   - Create pattern recognition across different projects
   - Implement feedback loop for continuous improvement
   - Develop specialization models for different AI systems

## Dependencies and Requirements
- Python for CLI tool implementation
- Structured communication with multiple AI systems
- Standard document formats for cross-compatibility
- Access to multiple AI models (Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini)
