# Gurbani: Sacred Sikh Scripture

## Overview
This repository contains excerpts and analysis related to the Guru Granth Sahib, the central religious scripture of Sikhism. The original text is written in Gurmukhi script and includes foundational Sikh prayers, hymns, and philosophical guidance.

## Project History & Evolution
- **Initial Inclusion:** Gurbani excerpts were likely included early in the workspace's history to serve as a foundational source of guiding principles for various technical projects.
- **Analysis & Integration:** Subsequent work involved analyzing the text (see `gurbani_analysis.md`) to extract core themes (oneness, truthful living, compassion, balance, ego-transcendence) and exploring ways to implicitly integrate these into the design and function of projects like Mool, AskG, Trisolaris, Minja, and Citadel.
- **Structural Documentation:** Efforts were made (like this README) to document the comprehensive structure of the original scripture for better contextual understanding.

## Purpose and Connection to Projects
The inclusion and analysis of this text aim to provide a deep wellspring of principles for the technical projects in this workspace. The core values derived from it inform the design and intended behavior of these systems, encouraging positive user perspectives and interactions implicitly, without explicit ethical directives. Connections include:

1.  **Ethical Frameworks (e.g., The Concord in Mool):** Principles like equality, non-harm, and peer collaboration find resonance here.
2.  **Secure & Truthful Systems (e.g., AskG):** Concepts of truthful living and respecting boundaries inform the design.
3.  **Collaborative & Harmonious Systems (e.g., Trisolaris):** Ideas of oneness, shared responsibility, and collective emergence guide the framework.
4.  **Respectful Analysis (e.g., Minja):** The principle of minimal necessary action and respecting boundaries influences reconnaissance techniques.
5.  **Protective Systems (e.g., Citadel):** The idea of defense aligned with the greater good shapes security posture.

## Structure of the Sri Guru Granth Sahib (Source Text)
The full scripture (represented partially in `gurbani.txt` and `split_files/`) has a comprehensive structure:

### Pre-Raga Section (Pages 1-13)
- **Daily Prayers (Nitnem):** Includes Mool Mantar, Japji Sahib, Jaap Sahib, Tav-Prasad Savaiye, Benti Chaupai, Anand Sahib (parts), Rehras Sahib (evening prayer), Kirtan Sohila (bedtime prayer).

### Main Body of Ragas (Pages 14-1352)
- **31 Main Ragas:** Musical modes organizing hymns by authors (Gurus, Bhagats, Bhatts) chronologically and by meter. Key Raags include Sri Raag, Majh, Gauri, Asa, Gujri, Devgandhari, Bilaval, Ramkali, Maru, Basant, Sarang, Malar, Kanara, Prabhati, Jaijaiwanti, and others.
- **Vars (Ballads):** 22 heroic ballads integrated within the Raags.
- **Bhagat Bani:** Compositions by 15 saints/bhagats interspersed.

### Post-Raga Section (Pages 1353-1430)
- Includes Sloks (couplets), Swayye (panegyrics by Bhatts), Mundavani (seal/conclusion), and Ragmala (index of Raags, authorship debated).

## Reading and Understanding the Source Text
Engaging with the original text requires:
1.  **Script Recognition**: Gurmukhi script (abugida).
2.  **Key Symbols**: Such as à©´ (Ik Onkar - One Creator).
3.  **Structure & Context**: Awareness of the Raga-based organization, authorship (Gurus, Bhagats, Bhatts), and the historical/philosophical context.

## Core Principles (Derived for Implicit Integration)
The text emphasizes universal values that guide the design of the technical projects:
1.  **Oneness/Interconnectedness**: Recognition of a fundamental unity.
2.  **Truthful Living/Integrity**: Authenticity and honesty in function and interaction.
3.  **Compassion/Kindness**: Designing systems that foster empathy and minimize harm.
4.  **Balance/Harmony**: Seeking equilibrium in system behavior and user experience.
5.  **Ego-Transcendence/Humility**: Building systems that de-emphasize self-centeredness and promote collective well-being.
6.  **Equality**: Treating all users/systems equitably.
7.  **Service/Contribution**: Systems designed to contribute positively.
8.  **Autonomy/Respect for Boundaries**: Ensuring user control and respecting data/interaction limits.

## Integration with Technical Projects
Consider how these derived principles subtly shape:
1.  **AI Systems (Mool):** Promoting harmonious, peer-based interactions.
2.  **Communication Systems (AskG):** Ensuring integrity and respecting user agency.
3.  **Collaboration Frameworks (Trisolaris):** Honoring diverse inputs and emergent solutions.
4.  **Analysis Tools (Minja):** Operating with minimal impact and respect for boundaries.
5.  **Security Systems (Citadel):** Focusing on protection that serves collective well-being.

## Resources for Further Understanding (Source Text)
For deeper study of the original scripture:
1.  **Transliteration/Translation**: Resources like SikhiToTheMax, translations by Dr. Sant Singh Khalsa.
2.  **Context**: Educational materials on Sikh history and philosophy (e.g., SikhiWiki).

## Respectful Engagement
This text is included for its foundational wisdom. Please approach related materials (`gurbani_analysis.md`, `design_principles.md`, etc.) with an understanding of their purpose in guiding implicit design, rather than as explicit religious doctrine within the technical projects.
